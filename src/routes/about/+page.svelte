<p align="justify">
    Hi! I'm Gerald, a (to-be) undergraduate studying Computer Science. 
    I'm a programmer, with a strong passion for software engineering and machine learning.
    That being said, I have an interest in all kinds of coding applications, from game-making to web3 and so on.

<p align="justify">
    As a student, one of my current goals is to get as much exposure and practice programming as I can.
    To that end, this portfolio also serves a role as a progress tracker, to see what I've accomplished so far.
